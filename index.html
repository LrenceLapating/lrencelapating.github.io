    <h3>Web Developers in different society hits diff!.</h3>

    <p>Web development is the process of creating websites or web applications that are accessible through the internet. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including web design, front-end development, back-end development, and web server configuration. Here are some key aspects of web development.</p>

    <p>Web Hosting and Deployment: After developing a website or web application, it needs to be hosted on a web server and made accessible to users on the internet. This involves configuring web servers, domain registration, and deploying the application. Popular hosting platforms include AWS, Azure, Heroku, and shared hosting providers.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>

    <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated to research, education and public outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a well-publicized "State of the Lake" assessment report.</p>
